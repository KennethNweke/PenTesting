# Penetration Testing Election-1 VM
![PT-01](https://github.com/KennethNweke/PenTesting/assets/88651458/b937699f-1064-4b3f-9550-7995098f5fd7)

## Objective

The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world penetration testing scenario by compromising a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) named Election 1 by applying various penetration testing techniques to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, ultimately gaining root or administrative access.

## Skills Learned

- **Information Gathering**:
  - Performing reconnaissance to collect information about the target VM.
  - Using tools like Nmap, for network scanning and service enumeration.

- **Vulnerability Analysis**:
  - Identifying potential vulnerabilities in services and applications running on the target VM.
  - Using vulnerability scanning tools like OpenVAS and Nessus.

- **Exploitation**:
  -  Eexecuting exploits to compromise vulnerable services
  -  Using open ports to access available services

- **Reporting**:
  - Documenting the findings in a comprehensive report.
  - Providing detailed descriptions of vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and recommended mitigations.

## Tools Used
- Oracle Virtual Box
- Election 1 VM from Vulnhub
- Linux Kali

## Steps
- The Election 1 VM  and the Kali Linux attack machine were both hosted on Oracle Virtual Box
