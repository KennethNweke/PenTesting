## Objective

The Network Hardening project aimed to establish a secure network topology. The primary focus was to enhance the security and resilience of a network by applying various hardening techniques by identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security controls, and following best practices to protect network infrastructure from potential threats. 

## Skills Learned

- **Vulnerability Assessment**:
  - Conducting thorough vulnerability scans using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
  - Analyzing scan results to identify and prioritize network vulnerabilities.

- **Firewall Configuration**:
  - Setting up and configuring firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
  - Creating and managing rules to allow or block specific types of traffic.

- **Implementing Site-to-site VPN**:
  - Implementing site-to-site VPN for secure access over the internet.

- **Access Control Management**:
  - Configuring and managing access control lists (ACLs) on network devices.

- **Network Device Hardening**:
  - Securing routers, switches, and other network devices by disabling unused services and ports.
  - Updating firmware and applying security patches.

- **Network Documentation**:
  - Drafting network topology, design, and security documentation.

- **Security Testing and Validation**:
  - Running tests to ensure devices are secure and align with business policy.

## Tools Used
